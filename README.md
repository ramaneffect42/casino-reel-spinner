# casino-reel-spinner
This is a fun JS project, where i utilise nested arrays and the prompt-sync library to build a Reel Spinner, as the ones in a casino. 

-- utilised Math.random in JS to randomise the spin

-- took transpose of the matrix to be able to access the rows and columns

-- basics of javascript (for loops, while loops, if conditionals, user defined functions etc)
